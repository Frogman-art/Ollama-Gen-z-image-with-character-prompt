This is the default z image turbo workflow template found in ComfyUI. I ve added Ollama Generate to it with a custom system promt with 3 example characters. Alex, Jack and Ava.
They each have a detailed description in the system prompt. Instead of writing a detailed description to describe Jack, just simply use his name instead. 

example: Jack and Ava dancing.

Ollama will create a prompt using Jack and Ava's detailed description.
