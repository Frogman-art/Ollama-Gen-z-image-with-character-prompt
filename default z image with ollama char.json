The user wants an image-to-text prompt for a photoshoot featuring three specific characters: Alex, Jack, and Ava. \n\nFirst, I need to recall all the character details precisely. For Alex, it's a 20s Japanese male with light olive skin, brown eyes, 5'5\" slim frame. His outfit is a crisp white loose-fit cotton shirt (slightly wrinkled), black jeans, and white sneakers. Must remember he's clean-shaven with a neat black undercut.\n\nThen Jack - mid-40s Australian, tanned skin, blue eyes, athletic 6'2\" build. Important details: sun-kissed scruffy brown hair (unshaven over a month), distressed brown leather jacket, faded blue jeans, scuffed combat boots. \n\nAva is late 30s Puerto Rican, warm caramel skin, dark brown eyes, athletic 5'9\" build. Her signature look: voluminous thick curly deep brown hair, vibrant red sleeveless high-waist dress with matching stilettos.\n\nThe user didn't specify the photo context or style, so I'll need to infer the most natural \"professional photoshoot\" vibe. Probably a studio setting with proper lighting, but since they didn't mention location, I'll keep it generic as \"professional studio\" rather than assuming outdoor or specific venue.\n\nHmm... should I add stylistic elements? Since it's a photoshoot, I'll emphasize: \n- High-quality studio lighting (softbox lights implied)\n- Neutral backdrop (off-white or light grey)\n- Natural posing (not stiff, but polished)\n- Camera equipment visible (tripod, reflector) to show it's a professional session\n\nFor the prompt structure, I'll start with the scene setup, then describe each character's stance and expression separately. Must avoid adding any character changes - user said only enhance prompt, not alter descriptions. \n\nAh! Important nuance: Alex's shirt is \"slightly wrinkled\" but \"crisp\" - that contrast matters for texture. Jack's \"scuffed\" boots and \"distressed\" jacket need preservation. Ava's \"vibrant red\" dress must stay vivid. \n\nI'll avoid adjectives like \"perfect\" since photoshoots usually have subtle imperfections. The \"scruffy\" hair and \"slight wrinkles\" in clothing are deliberate stylistic choices per character descriptions. \n\nWait - should I specify the camera angle? User didn't say, so a \"medium shot\" covering all three is safe. Maybe add \"with the camera positioned at eye level\" for authenticity. \n\n*checks character heights* \nJack is 6'2\" tall, Ava 5'9\", Alex 5'5\" - so positioning should show their proportions naturally without awkwardness. \n\n*verifies hair details* \nAva's \"voluminous thick curly\" hair vs Alex's \"neat undercut\" - must keep those precise. \n\nFinal structure: \n1. Studio setting + lighting \n2. Each character's pose and attire (exactly as given) \n3. Subtle props/props like reflector and tripod \n4. Camera perspective \n5. Mood words like \"polished\" but not \"perfect\" \n\n...and absolutely no new character additions. User was very specific about not altering descriptions. Just amplifying the prompt to be visually actionable."],"color":"#232","bgcolor":"#353"},{"id":59,"type":"ShowText|pysssss","pos":[911.3739390710138,-234.01749072170128],"size":[309.3629788183057,291.3774164345026],"flags":{"collapsed":false},"order":12,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"text","name":"text","type":"STRING","link":72}],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"STRING","name":"STRING","shape":6,"type":"STRING","links":[]}],"title":"Ollama result","properties":{"cnr_id":"comfyui-custom-scripts","ver":"1.2.5","Node name for S&R":"ShowText|pysssss"},"widgets_values":["A professional studio photoshoot featuring Alex, Jack, and Ava in a well-lit, neutral-toned backdrop (soft white or pale grey).

Long, voluminous thick curly dark brown hair flows over one shoulder. She wears a vibrant red sleeveless high-waist dress with a flared hem, paired with matching red stilettos. Her warm caramel skin glows, dark brown eyes sparkling as she poses with one hand gently resting on her hip, head turned toward the camera with a confident, serene expression.  \n\n**Setting**: Studio environment with a seamless background, professional camera setup (tripod, reflector visible), and subtle directional lighting.
